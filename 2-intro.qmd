Probability, random variables, probability distributions and simulations

- Focus: Random variables, distributions and the link to simulations.
- Key topics: Probability distributions, conditional probability, independence, the law of large numbers, pseudo-random numbers.
- Special Emphasis: Estimating the probability of complex outcomes through simulations.
