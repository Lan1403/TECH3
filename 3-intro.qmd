Estimation, sampling distributions and resampling

- Focus: Modern inference using Monte Carlo methods. 
- Key topics: Central limit theorem, sampling error of various statistics, Monte Carlo simulation.
- Special Emphasis: Distinguish between a population and a sample and between population parameters and sample statistics.
