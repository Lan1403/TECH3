## Controll questions

1.  What is an experiment?
2.  What is an outcome?
3.  What is the sample space?
4.  What is an event?
5.  In a dice-throwing experiment, if event 𝐴 is "rolling a 1, 2, or 3," what is the complement of 𝐴?
6.  For events 𝐴 (rolling a 1 or 2) and 𝐵 (rolling a 2, 3, or 4), describe their intersection and how it would appear in a Venn diagram.
7.  Using the same events 𝐴 and 𝐵 as above, describe their union. What does it represent, and how would you illustrate it in a Venn diagram?
