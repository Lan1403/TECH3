A probability distribution is a function defined on the sample space which is non-negative and such that the sum of all function values is $1=100\ \%$.

### Problem 1

An experiment can have three different outcomes, A, B, or C. The experiment is repeated twice, and the probabilities for the different outcomes are given in the table below.

```{r, echo = FALSE, output = "asis", message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, include = FALSE}
library(knitr)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  warning=FALSE, message=FALSE
)
library(tidyverse)
library(xtable)
Outcomes <- c("AA", "AB", "AC","BA","BB", "BC", "CA","CB","CC")
Probability <- c(30,5,5,5,20,5,5,5,20)
prob.table <- tibble(Outcomes, 
                     "Probability"= c(30,5,5,5,20,5,5,5,20)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = Outcomes, 
              values_from = Probability) %>% 
  mutate(.row = "Probability (%)") %>%
  column_to_rownames(".row")
knitr::kable(prob.table,format = "markdown")
```

(a) Why is this a probability distribution?

(b) How large is the probability that we get the outcome A in the first experiment?

(c) How large is the probability that we get A as an outcome of the second experiment?

(d) Does the outcome of the first experiment affect the probabilities of the outcomes of the second experiment?

### Problem 2

An experiment can have three different outcomes, A, B, or C. The experiment is repeated twice, and the probabilities for the different outcomes are given in the table below.

```{r, echo = FALSE, output = "asis"}
prob.table <- tibble(Outcomes, 
                     Probability=c(16, 12, 12, 12, 9, 9, 12, 9, 9)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = Outcomes,
              values_from = Probability) %>% 
  mutate(.row = "Probability (%)") %>%
  column_to_rownames(".row")
knitr::kable(prob.table,format = "markdown")
```

(a) Why is this a probability distribution?

(b) How large is the probability that we get the outcome A in the first experiment?

(c) How large is the probability that we get A as an outcome of the second experiment?

(d) Does the outcome of the first experiment affect the probabilities of the outcomes of the second experiment?

### Problem 3

Recall the general addition rule: $$P(A\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cap B).$$

(a) Assume that $P(A)=0.2,P(B)=0.3, P(A\cap B)=0.1$. What is $P(A\cup B)$?

(b) Assume that $P(A)=0.3,P(B)=0.4, P(A\cup B)=0.5$. What is $P(A\cap B)$?

(c) Assume that $P(B)=0.4, P(A\cap B)=0.1,P(A\cup B)=0.6$. What is $P(A)$?

(d) Assume that $P(A)=0.5, P(A\cap B)=0.2,P(A\cup B)=0.7$. What is $P(B)$?

### Problem 4

<!-- Chapter 4 fra Jan Uboe -->

How do we compute a conditional probability? $$P(A|B)={{P(A\cap B)}\over{P(B)}}$$ We must find the probability of the intersection and divide the answer by the probability of the conditioning event.

(a) Assume that $P(A)=0.5,P(B)=0.3, P(A\cap B)=0.15$. What is $P(A|B)$?
(b) Is it always true that $P(A|B)=P(B|A)$?
(c) Assume that $P(B)=0.3,P(A|B)=0.7$. What is $P(A\cap B)$?
(d) Assume that $P(A)=0.3,P(B)=0.6, P(A|B)=0.4$. Find $P(A\cap B)$ and use the answer to compute $P(B|A)$.

### Problem 5

Bayes law says: $$P(B|A)=P(A|B)\cdot {{P(B)}\over{P(A)}}.$$

Assume that $P(A)=0.3,P(B)=0.6, P(A|B)=0.4$ (as in 1(d)). Use Bayes' law to compute $P(B|A)$.

### Problem 6

If we split the sample space into $n$ non-overlapping parts $B_1,\dots,B_n$, then $$P(A)=P(A|B_1)\cdot P(B_1)+P(A|B_2)\cdot P(B_2)+\cdots+P(A|B_n)\cdot P(B_n).$$ The most common application uses $n=2$. In that case there are only two terms.

(a) Assume that $P(B)=0.3, P(A|B)=0.5, P(A|B^c)=0.4$. Find $P(A)$.
(b) Assume that $P(A)=0.6, P(B)=0.4,P(A|B^c)=0.5$. Find $P(A|B)$.

### Problem 7

A financial analyst have considered the future development of several differnt stocks. One year later 20% of these stocks did better than the index, 30% performed approximately as the index, while the rest, 50%, performed considerably worse. 60% of the companies that were performing better than the index were rated A by the analyst, 5% of the companies at level with the index had the same rating, while only 3% of the stocks with bad performance were rated A.

(a) How many % of the stocks rated by the analyst, was rated A?
(b) What was that probablity of performing better than the index, given that the stock was rated A by the analyst?

### Problem 8

Under a trial concerning alleged women's discrimination (Berkeley, 1973) the following evidence were presented:

(a) The students had applied for admission to 6 different institutes, and the numbers for the woman applicants were as follows:

```{r, echo = FALSE, output = "asis"}
tibble("Institute" =  c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F"),
       "Fraction admitted (%)" = c(82, 68, 34, 35, 24, 7),
       "Fraction of female applicants (%)" =  c(6, 1, 32, 20, 22, 19)) %>% 
  t() %>% 
  knitr::kable(type = "markdown")
```

The applicants only applied for admission to one institute. Find the fraction of female applicants that were admitted.

(b) The corresponding results for men were as follows:

```{r, echo = FALSE, output = "asis"}

tibble("Institute" =  c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F"),
       "Fraction admitted (%)" = c(62, 63, 37, 33, 28, 6),
       "Fraction of male applicants (%)" =  c(32, 22, 12, 16, 7, 11)) %>% 
  t() %>% 
  knitr::kable(format = "markdown")
```

Find the fraction of male applicants that were admitted.

(c) The results from (a) and (b) imply that men had approximately 50% higher chance of being admitted. Was the women discriminated? What is the cause that so few women were admitted?

### Problem 9

How do we find the absolute probabilities in a tree with conditional probabilities? We find the unconditional probabilities multiplying along each branch.

The results from a poll is summarized in the tree below.

![](images/FigurTree.png)

(a) How many percent of young men answered no on the question? How many percent of older women answered yes?
(b) Convert the tree to a tree with absolute probabilities.
(c) How many percent answered yes on the question in this poll? How many percent of the women answered yes?
